## Summary
**Goal:** Add "Sea Foods" as a new product category to the Kodinar Bazaar marketplace.

**Planned changes:**
- Add "Sea Foods" to the backend's valid category list so products can be assigned this category.
- Add "Sea Foods" to the category dropdown in the ProductForm on the Seller Dashboard.
- Add "Sea Foods" as a filter option in the category sidebar on the ProductsPage.

**User-visible outcome:** Sellers can now assign "Sea Foods" to their product listings, and buyers can filter products by the "Sea Foods" category on the products page.
